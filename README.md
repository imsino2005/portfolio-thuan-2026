# Portfolio Thuan 2026

Hi! I'm **Nguyen Minh Thuan** (born in 2005, living in Dong Thap Province).

This is my 1-year fullstack development journey (started on February 24, 2026).  
Goal: By the end of 2026, build a strong portfolio and apply for a **Junior Fullstack Developer (MERN stack)** position in Ho Chi Minh City.

## Day 1 – February 24, 2026
- Learned basic HTML structure  
- Created first portfolio page (`index.html`)  
- Ran locally using Live Server in VS Code  
- Pushed code to GitHub  

Live demo (coming soon via GitHub Pages): https://imsino2005.github.io/portfolio-thuan-2026/

Tech stack I'm learning: HTML → CSS → JavaScript → React → Node.js → MongoDB

Follow my progress! 💪🚀
